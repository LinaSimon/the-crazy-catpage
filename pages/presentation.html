                    <h2>1. What is your project and why did you choose to do it?</h2>
                    <p>I chose to create a framework for a future portfolio
                        because I thought it would be handy to have started
                        building it already.</p>

                    <h2>2. What is the biggest problem you faced building your
                        site and how did you solve it?</h2>
                    <p>Except from the JS fetching the random cats, it was
                        definitely trying to make the site responsive. When you
                        change something in the style, something else crashes
                        and it seems to go on and on forever…</p>

                <div class="qa"><img src="../images/cat_qa3.png">
                    <h2>3. How did you plan your project and how did you follow
                        that plan?</h2>
                    <p>I found a website I liked <a
                            href="https://vitaarchitecture.com/">vitaarchitecture.com</a>
                        and used as inspiration but of course my site doesn’t
                        look anything like it. Maybe someday…. :D
                        <br>I didn’t follow my plan at all! It was boring not to
                        have any content so - the portfolio turned into a silly
                        mini site with cats, which was more fun. </p>

                    <h2>4. What are you most proud of in your project?</h2>
                    <p>I’m most proud of the JS. I think it’s ok for a beginner
                        even though I got help from a friend. :)</p>

                        <h2>5. What are your greatest learnings doing this
                            project?</h2>
                        <p>My greatest learning is that planning is essential.
                            It takes so much time to just follow your feelings
                            and try stuff out with no real plan. It was ok
                            though, because I needed to explore and try out a
                            million things, to be able to learn stuff. Also, to
                            NAME classes and id:s in a logical way. And to use
                            sass.</p>
